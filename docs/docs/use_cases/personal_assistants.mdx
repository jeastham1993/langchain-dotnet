# Personal Assistants

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/use-cases/personal-assistants)
:::

We use "personal assistant" here in a very broad sense.
Personal assistants have a few characteristics:

- They can interact with the outside world
- They have knowledge of your data
- They remember your interactions

Really all of the functionality in LangChain is relevant for building a personal assistant.
Highlighting specific parts:

- [Agent Documentation](../modules/agents/index.mdx) (for interacting with the outside world)
- [Index Documentation](../modules/indexes/index.mdx) (for giving them knowledge of your data)
- [Memory](../modules/memory/index.mdx) (for helping them remember interactions)
