# Agent Executors

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents/agent-executor)
:::

To make agents more powerful we need to make them iterative, ie. call the model multiple times until they arrive at the final answer. That's the job of the AgentExecutor.

```typescript
class AgentExecutor {
  // a simplified implementation
  run(inputs: object) {
    const steps = [];
    while (true) {
      const step = await this.agent.plan(steps, inputs);
      if (step instanceof AgentFinish) {
        return step.returnValues;
      }
      steps.push(step);
    }
  }
}
```
