# VectorStore-backed Memory

`VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` stores memories in a VectorDB and queries the top-K most "salient" docs every time it is called.

This differs from most of the other Memory classes in that it doesn't explicitly track the order of interactions.

In this case, the "docs" are previous conversation snippets. This can be useful to refer to relevant pieces of information that the AI was told earlier in the conversation.
