# Conversation Summary Memory

The Conversation Summary Memory summarizes the conversation as it happens and stores the current summary in memory. This memory can then be used to inject the summary of the conversation so far into a prompt/chain. This memory is most useful for longer conversations, where keeping the past message history in the prompt verbatim would take up too many tokens.

## Usage, with an LLM

import TextExample from "@examples/memory/summary_llm.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{TextExample}</CodeBlock>

## Usage, with a Chat Model

import ChatExample from "@examples/memory/summary_chat.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ChatExample}</CodeBlock>
