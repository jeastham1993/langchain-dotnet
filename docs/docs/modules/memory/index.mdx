# Getting Started: Memory

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/memory)
:::

Memory is the concept of storing and retrieving data in the process of a conversation. There are two main methods, `loadMemoryVariables` and `saveContext`. The first method is used to retrieve data from memory (optionally using the current input values), and the second method is used to store data in memory.

```typescript
export type InputValues = Record<string, any>;

export type OutputValues = Record<string, any>;

interface BaseMemory {
  loadMemoryVariables(values: InputValues): Promise<MemoryVariables>;

  saveContext(
    inputValues: InputValues,
    outputValues: OutputValues
  ): Promise<void>;
}
```

:::note
Do not share the same memory instance between two different chains, a memory instance represents the history of a single conversation
:::

:::note
If you deploy your LangChain app on a serverless environment do not store memory instances in a variable, as your hosting provider may have reset it by the next time the function is called.

## All Memory classes

## Advanced

To implement your own memory class you have two options:

### Subclassing `BaseChatMemory`

This is the easiest way to implement your own memory class. You can subclass `BaseChatMemory`, which takes care of `saveContext` by saving inputs and outputs as [Chat Messages](../schema/chat-messages.md), and implement only the `loadMemoryVariables` method. This method is responsible for returning the memory variables that are relevant for the current input values.

```typescript
abstract class BaseChatMemory extends BaseMemory {
  chatHistory: ChatMessageHistory;

  abstract loadMemoryVariables(values: InputValues): Promise<MemoryVariables>;
}
```

### Subclassing `BaseMemory`

If you want to implement a more custom memory class, you can subclass `BaseMemory` and implement both `loadMemoryVariables` and `saveContext` methods. The `saveContext` method is responsible for storing the input and output values in memory. The `loadMemoryVariables` method is responsible for returning the memory variables that are relevant for the current input values.

```typescript
abstract class BaseMemory {
  abstract loadMemoryVariables(values: InputValues): Promise<MemoryVariables>;

  abstract saveContext(
    inputValues: InputValues,
    outputValues: OutputValues
  ): Promise<void>;
}
```
