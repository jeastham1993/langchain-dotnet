# Models

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/models/)
:::

Models are a core component of LangChain. LangChain is not a provider of models, but rather provides a standard interface through which you can interact with a variety of language models.
LangChain provides support for both text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Chat Models, and Text Embedding models.

LLMs use a text-based input and output, while Chat Models use a message-based input and output.

> **_Note:_** Chat model APIs are fairly new, so we are still figuring out the correct abstractions. If you have any feedback, please let us know!

## All Models

_This section is for users who want a deeper technical understanding of how LangChain works. If you are just getting started, you can skip this section._

Both LLMs and Chat Models are built on top of the `BaseLanguageModel` class. This class provides a common interface for all models, and allows us to easily swap out models in chains without changing the rest of the code.

The `BaseLanguageModel` class has two abstract methods: `generatePrompt` and `getNumTokens`, which are implemented by `BaseChatModel` and `BaseLLM` respectively.

`BaseLLM` is a subclass of `BaseLanguageModel` that provides a common interface for LLMs while `BaseChatModel` is a subclass of `BaseLanguageModel` that provides a common interface for chat models.
