# Output Parsers

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/prompts/output-parser)
:::

Language models output text. But many times you may want to get more structured information than just text back. This is where output parsers come in.

Output parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must implement:

- `getFormatInstructions(): str` A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.
- `parse(raw: string): any` A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.

And then one optional one:

- `parseWithPrompt(text: string, prompt: BasePromptValue): any`: A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a formatted prompt (assumed to the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.

Below we go over some examples of output parsers.

## Structured Output Parser

This output parser can be used when you want to return multiple fields.

import Structured from "@examples/prompts/structured_parser.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Structured}</CodeBlock>

## Structured Output Parser with Zod Schema

This output parser can be also be used when you want to define the output schema using Zod, a TypeScript validation library. The Zod schema passed in needs be parseable from a JSON string, so eg. `z.date()` is not allowed, but `z.coerce.date()` is.

import StructuredZod from "@examples/prompts/structured_parser_zod.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StructuredZod}</CodeBlock>

## Output Fixing Parser

This output parser wraps another output parser, and in the event that the first one fails it calls out to another LLM to fix any errors.

import Fix from "@examples/prompts/fix_parser.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Fix}</CodeBlock>

## Comma-separated List Parser

This output parser can be used when you want to return a list of items.

import Comma from "@examples/prompts/comma_list_parser.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Comma}</CodeBlock>

## Combining Output Parsers

Output parsers can be combined using `CombiningOutputParser`. This output parser takes in a list of output parsers, and will ask for (and parse) a combined output that contains all the fields of all the parsers.

import Combining from "@examples/prompts/combining_parser.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Combining}</CodeBlock>
