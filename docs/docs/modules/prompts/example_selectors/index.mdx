# Example Selectors

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/prompts/example-selectors)
:::

If you have a large number of examples, you may need to programmatically select which ones to include in the prompt. The ExampleSelector is the class responsible for doing so. The base interface is defined as below.

```typescript
class BaseExampleSelector {
  addExample(example: Example): Promise<void | string>;

  selectExamples(input_variables: Example): Promise<Example[]>;
}
```

It needs to expose a `selectExamples` - this takes in the input variables and then returns a list of examples method - and an `addExample` method, which saves an example for later selection. It is up to each specific implementation as to how those examples are saved and selected. Letâ€™s take a look at some below.

## Select by Length

This `ExampleSelector` selects which examples to use based on length. This is useful when you are worried about constructing a prompt that will go over the length of the context window. For longer inputs, it will select fewer examples to include, while for shorter inputs it will select more.

import ExampleLength from "@examples/prompts/length_based_example_selector.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleLength}</CodeBlock>

## Select by Similarity

The `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` selects examples based on which examples are most similar to the inputs. It does this by finding the examples with the embeddings that have the greatest cosine similarity with the inputs.

import ExampleSimilarity from "@examples/prompts/semantic_similarity_example_selector.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleSimilarity}</CodeBlock>
