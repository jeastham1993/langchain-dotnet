# Getting Started: LLMChain

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/chains/llm-chain)
:::

An `LLMChain` is a simple chain that adds some functionality around language models. It is used widely throughout LangChain, including in other chains and agents.

An `LLMChain` consists of a `PromptTemplate` and a language model (either an [LLM](../models/llms/) or [chat model](../models/chat/)).

We can construct an LLMChain which takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
