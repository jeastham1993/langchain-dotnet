# Getting Started: Chains

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/chains)
:::info

Using a language model in isolation is fine for some applications, but it is often useful to combine language models with other sources of information, third-party APIs, or even other language models. This is where the concept of a chain comes in.

LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, as well as a number of built-in chains that can be used out of the box. You can also create your own chains.

## Advanced

To implement your own custom chain you can subclass `BaseChain` and implement the following methods:

import SubclassInterface from "@examples/chains/advanced_subclass.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SubclassInterface}</CodeBlock>

### Subclassing `BaseChain`

The `_call` method is the main method custom chains must implement. It takes a record of inputs and returns a record of outputs. The inputs received should conform the `inputKeys` array, and the outputs returned should conform to the `outputKeys` array.

When implementing this method in a custom chain it's worth paying special attention to the `runManager` argument, which is what allows your custom chains to participate in the same [callbacks system](../../production/callbacks/) as the built-in chains.

If you call into another chain/model/agent inside your custom chain then you should pass it the result of calling `runManager?.getChild()` which will produce a new callback manager scoped to that inner run. An example:

import SubclassCall from "@examples/chains/advanced_subclass_call.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SubclassCall}</CodeBlock>
