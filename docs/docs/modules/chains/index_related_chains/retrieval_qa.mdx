# Retrieval QA

The `RetrievalQAChain` is a chain that combines a `Retriever` and a QA chain (described above). It is used to retrieve documents from a `Retriever` and then use a `QA` chain to answer a question based on the retrieved documents.

## Usage

In the below example, we are using a `VectorStore` as the `Retriever`. By default, the `StuffDocumentsChain` is used as the `QA` chain.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RetrievalQAExample}</CodeBlock>

## Usage, with a custom `QA` chain

In the below example, we are using a `VectorStore` as the `Retriever` and a `RefineDocumentsChain` as the `QA` chain.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RetrievalQAExampleCustom}</CodeBlock>
